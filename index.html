			<p>At Aicella I created a new AI-driven data analytics frontend called AiCella Insights that makes cancer patient trial data more readable and usable formedical professionals identifying Cancer T-Cell treatment. Created a scalable database in SQL Server Management Studio and AWS to be queried by the website and cleaned data from 20 different clinical trials to be fed into our AI learning models. Aicella Insights utilized seven models which included kNN and Decision Trees which allowed for in-depth analysis of critical process parameters, enabling the identification of subtle patterns and correlations that are pivotal for optimizing cell therapy processes.</p>
			<p>Worked with lead Immunologist to vizualize data produced by our AI learning models using R and Plotly. These visualizations were used for presentations to investors and potential partner biotech companies such as Bullpen and CytoHub at JPM Week 2024 and Phacilitate Advanced Therapies Week 2024.</p>
